    <h1 class="article title"></h1></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>discussed the idea of &#34;connecting with people&#34; with anish, and realized we&#39;ve both thought about modeling conversation as an LTI system</p>
<p>
also the idea of &#34;modeling luck&#34; in terms of exposure to new activities, and how to maximize luck (and/or utility, when looking for novel experience in life)
each activity provides some amount of diminishing returns, a sort of hump-y function of time, and &#34;total experience&#34; or &#34;total luck exposure&#34; is a weighted sum of these f(time_commitment) functions, where sum(time_commitment) &lt;= total_free_time</p>
<p>
my conversational ability is kind of like a LTI transfer function (except mine is not actually linear)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>its locally time-invariant, that is, slowly-changing characteristics over time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>characteristics also depend on the person im talking to, or more simply, how comfortable i am talking with them</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>its causal - it works only in response to input</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>its BIBO stable, and more than that, responses have finite energy - they all die away eventually. for some inputs (in the MIMO sense), response is just 0. maybe UIBO? - unbounded input, bounded output</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>linearity: response depends on instantaneous &#34;features&#34; of input, which is a concept not captured by SISO LTI.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if MIMO, then each input/output can be thought of as a &#34;conversation topic&#34;, ie, politics, science, philosophy, popular media, etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the MIMO transfer function matrix is probably nearly diagonalâ€¦ how exactly does it deviate from diagonal? that is, how do the &#34;features&#34; of an input signal (cross terms) affect the output?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>can think of each i/o as having a positive and negative direction - positive matches my views, negative opposes my views</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MY response is decidedly not homogeneous - eg, strong response to positive political input, but zero response to negative political input. this represents the fact that i am &#34;reserved&#34; in conversation</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a lot of people probably have saturation-like effects on their output - a limit to how much they have to say about a given topic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some people probably have saturation-like effects on their input too - a limit to how much they want to hear about a topic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>superposition probably holds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not characterizable by impulse function because nonlinear</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>conversation between two people can be represented by feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>conversation including M topics between N people requires ~M*N^2 2-way links - one for each topic between each pair of people</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Conversational interaction resembles a system in the &#34;LTI system&#34; sense, though not necessarily linear nor time-invariant. Think of an individual as maintaining a transfer function, with heard speech as input, and spoken speech as output. Proper LTI systems and transfer functions are categorized with a variety of properties, many of which fit this analogy well.</p>
