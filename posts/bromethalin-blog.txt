i'm not sure why i thought to check on the thing he was chewing on. it looked like a green biscuit with some weird colored bits in it. i actually thought it was a christmas themed dog treat, not sure why i thought i should ask my dad if he recognized it. but i did check, i did ask, my dad was right there and he knew what it was. i freaked out, started to make gizmo throw up, he did NOT like that, my hand is all chewed up. i simultaneously directed lisa and dad to do the five other things that needed to happen. fiona IMMEDIATELY seized the opportunity to eat whatever scrap was left over.
